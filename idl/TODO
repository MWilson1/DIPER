SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE to estimate collisions better than 0.1/z/z...
(IC transitions, for example..)

pert_xxx  perturbations.

crit procedure

get LS -> J splitting PI XS data (change bfrd.pro)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is perhaps a problem with the xxx.ref  apparently.  

Looks like cbb database was not build correctly!
Following ions have -1 for the b-b collisional reference:

Ni XIII      Bhatia & Doschek 1998...
Fe XVII      Landi & Gu 2005 
Fe XXII      Badnell, N. R., Griffin, D. C., 
O II         Mc Laughlin, B. M., Bell, K. L., 
O V          (none)
C III        Berrington et al., 1985
C V          Sampson, D.H., Goett, S.J.,
He II        Connor Ballance (private communications)

The string "Connor Ballance" is only found in atom.he2, but it appears
4 times in the atom_bib file. Suggests 
  cbb2db and/or bib_idx might be a culprit

1. get NIST Ca II data and use old collision strengths. remove bad entries and
   fix Ca II atom refs.  

2. synth (integrate G(T) and xi(T)) vs. model (ne(z),nh(z),Te(z))
